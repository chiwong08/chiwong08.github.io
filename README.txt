### Summary
I've been a software developer for 20 years.
I've held various positions such as Senior Developer, Senior IT Specialist, Senior Analyst Programmer and Systems Analyst.
They've been in the financial services industry, working with Oracle and Sybase running on enterprise unix based systems.
Development-wise, I've mainly been focused on OO programming with C++, but I have dabbled a bit with java and python.

Outside of work, I'm a foodie and take every opportunity to try new restaurants.  
Memorable places include Whatley Manor in Malmesbury, The Moody Cow in Ross-on-Wye, The Waterside Inn in Bray 
and many more in London, of which Seven Park Place by William Drabble is a favourite.
